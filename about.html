            <p>Heya! I'm Sean Jefferson M. Calaoagan, a college freshman taking up Computer Science with Specialization in AI and Cloud Computing in CIIT College of Arts and Technology. I was born in Tondo, Manila on November 29, 2006. In person, I'm quite introverted especially with strangers, though I can speak well in presentations. I like to write stories and solve programming problems.</p>

                <h2>Skills Summary</h2>
                <p>For hard skills, I would be proficient in Python and C++. I'm mainly focusing on Python as it is the prominent language in AI Engineering. I also used a language similar to Python called GDScript to develop games. Outside of coding, I'm also proficient in writing and editing videos. I have made plenty of scripts for my channel and my schoolworks.</p>

                <p>For soft skills, it would be teamwork, self motivation, responsibility, and time management. I participate actively in any group tasks and will step up to become a leader if I have to. I also take responsibility for every action that I do. I can motivate myself in tough times, and I can handle tasks well since I know when to make time for them.</p>

                <h2>Educational Background</h2>
                <ul>

                <h2>Strengths & Weaknesses</h2>
                <h3>Strengths</h3>
                <p>One of my strengths is my reliability. I make sure to deliver any tasks assigned to me without fail. I also excel in logical tasks such as programming since I can easily dissect it. The learning style I find to be the most effective is Kinesthetic. I like to learn hands-on and pretend that I'm giving a presentation while I explain concepts to myself.</p>
                <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
                <p>I'm very much the introverted type. I struggle to hold small talks for long, and my energy drains fast. I'm also the uncreative type, which is why I find it hard to form new ideas and do subjective tasks like essays, research papers, etc.</p>

                <h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
                <h3>"Carpe Diem"</h3>
                <p>Carpe Diem, or "Seize the day" is a philosophy I love to keep in mind. Worrying about the future is just you worrying about the what ifs and if nots. You should not neglect the now, as your now is the basis of your future.</p>

                <h2>Life Vision</h2>
                <p>My plan after college is to become an AI Engineer, or anyone who works closely with AI. I enjoy their potential while also understanding its effects on society, both good and bad. With this job, I hope to become financially stable and have enough time for my family. I believe the end goal of life is to have a worry-free life where you can do the things you want without being restricted by money nor any problems.</p>
