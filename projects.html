                    <p><b>Between Two Worlds</b> - A 3d platformer game made in Godot wherein you have the ability to flip between two worlds. Not only was this my first game that required actual programming, but it was also my first collaboration game, as this was made by me and my classmates. Our group is currently named Haroshirace.</p>

                    <p><b>Wondertap!</b> - A joke clicker game I made about Emu Otori and her infamous "Wonderhoy!" Despite it being a joke game, I did implement features not present in my past game, such as saving, the utilization of classes and global variables.</p>

                    <p><b>Mogi Kioku</b> - A game heavily inspired by Yume Nikki. Take control of Kajou as you explore what is behind the 4 doors, collecting pills along the way to progress. This game is my introduction to RPGMaker, and my way of learning the ropes of the engine.</p>

                    <p><b>The Day That You Left</b> - This is an hour long visual novel about Haruma, a college student whose childhood friend is going away for unknown reasons. This game centers on how Haruma deals with the said loss, as well as the unexpected friendship he'll build along the way. This game is created in Ren'py, a visual novel engine. It uses Python, and it was easy making the game itself. The only hard part was the writing of the story.</p>

                    <p><b>Passing Faces</b> - This is a ~10 minute visual novel about a man's daily life in the cafe. It entirely focuses on the people he meets at the cafe, and how he projects his own fears and doubts onto them. This visual novel was made in only 2 days. It was originally made as a showcase or demo for a workshop I spoke on, but I decided to go against it and make it into its own game.</p>

                <h2>Websites</h2>
                <p>Sadly, a lot of these websites are no longer accessible, as they were only done in fulfillment of my subjects' requirements, and were not meant to be kept up.</p>

                    <p><b>C.R.O.N.O.S (Check-in Record Organizer for Notifications and Overview of Students)</b> - This is my most “advanced” website to date. This website was done in fulfillment of my Programming Languages 2 subject, and our teacher specifically assigned this task to my group. It is an attendance checker, wherein a QR code scanner automatically inputs the student’s ID number into the field, registering the student as present on that day. It also has a built in tracker, where one can search for the students present during that time. This website utilizes Java with the Spring boot framework, Tomcat, and XAMPP.</p>

It is a security system that detects intruders in range, and automatically takes a picture of them and sends it to the programmed email.

We were tasked to make a horror radio drama, and this is what we came up with. All of this was edited by me in a span of one day due to time constraints, which led to me working for 8 hours straight.</p>

My teammate and I was placed into the accuracy category. Despite only 3 days of practice, we managed to get into 3rd place in accuracy. CIIT also won in the distance category, landing a 3rd place as well.</p>
